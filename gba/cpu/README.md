This test ROM attempts to fully test the GBA CPU by exercising every operation
and their corner cases. The tests are mostly autogenerated.

The inspiration for these tests come from:

 - armwrestler: https://github.com/destoer/armwrestler-gba-fixed
 - FuzzARM: https://github.com/DenSinH/FuzzARM
 - gba-tests: https://github.com/jsmolka/gba-tests

The ROM is quite big, since it ships all pre-calculated expected results for
each test.

The following operations are tested:

 * Thumb mode:
     * Unary operations: mvn, neg
     * Shift operations: lsr, lsl, ror, asr
     * Arithmetic: add, sub, adc, sbc, mul
     * Logical: and, orr, eor, bic
 * ARM mode:
     * Logical with immediate: and/s, orr/s, eor/s, bic/s
     * Arithmetic with immediate: add/s, adc/s, sub/s, sbc/s, rsb/s, rsc/s
     * Mov-shift (reg): lsr/s, lsl/s, ror/s, asr/s
     * Unary operations: mov/s, mvn/s
     * Logical (reg-reg): and/s, orr/s, eor/s, bic/s
     * Arithmetic (reg-reg): add/s, adc/s, sub/s, sbc/s, rsb/s, rsc/s, mul/s
     * 32 bit mul+add: mla/s
     * 64 bit mul: umull/s, smull/s
     * Logical (shifted reg): and/s, orr/s, eor/s, bic/s
     * Arithmetic (shifted reg): add/s, adc/s, sub/s, sbc/s
     * Unary operations (shifted reg): mov/s, mvn/s
     * Test operations (shifted reg): cmp, tst, cmn

What's *not* tested:

  * Carry and Overflow flags are ignored for MUL/MLA/MULL operations.

How tests are performed:

  * Test code and stubs are 32 bit ARM mode.
  * Test routines are copied to IWRAM before executing the test, for speed
    and also to be able to modifiy the instructions if needed.
  * Immediate tests copy the instruction-under-testing into IWRAM and patch it
    with the right immediate value.
